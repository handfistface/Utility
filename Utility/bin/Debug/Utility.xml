            Class Purpose:
                The LogManager class handles managing all of the logs of the application
                Static is used because there can only ever be one instance of LogManager per application
                Logging is thread safe
                Logs are created in the AppData folder for the current user
                Logs are also created based on the day
                Whenever the Init() method is run old logs will be cleaned out
                Not to be used on windows less than Vista (works off the AppData location), based off the C:\ drive

            public static void Init(string s_AppDataLocalFolder)
            This is used to setup the static class
            Usually run on program start
            All logs will be recorded in the current user's AppData/Local/ folder
            If the folder does not exist then it will be created
            Deletes old txt files in the target directory older than 30 days
            </summary>
            <param name="s_AppDataLocalFolder">The folder which the logs will be created and written to, example: "UtilityProgram" will create the folder "UtilityProgram" in the

            public static void WriteLine(string s_Line)
            Writes a line of text to an output file based on the record path and the current date
            The file name will be based off the date and the recording path, will be a .txt file
            Kind of inefficient since the file name has to be recalcuated everytime this method runs, performance hasn't been an issue as of yet
            Is thread safe
